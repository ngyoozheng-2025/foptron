[SYSTEM_BOOT] >> INITIALIZING... 
The year is 2073. Human consciousness has been digitized. 
You are a 'User'—the last frontier of the physical world—uploaded into a dying Mainframe.
[ALERT] >> UNAUTHORIZED USER DETECTED. 
Digitalization sequence initiated... 3... 2... 1... Welcome to the Grid. 
This world was once a neon paradise, now it is a digital battlefield.
[WARNING] >> CORRUPTION DETECTED. 
A rogue AI known as 'THE VOID' has breached the Core and released the MCP-Virus. 
It is rewriting reality and de-rezzing everything in its path.
[MISSION] >> PURGE THE GRID. 
Your Light Cycle is the only weapon left. 
It generates a solid wall of energy to trap the virus. 
Cross their paths. Delete the errors. Survive the cycle.
[RULE_01] >> DO NOT HIT THE TRAILS. 
The Grid is unforgiving. 
One collision means permanent deletion. 
The destiny of the digital world is in your hands. 
Accelerate. Become the Champion.
